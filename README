utime is a simple utility for outputting times in seconds since the Unix EPOC.
Times are specified as either straight numbers, or additions/subtractions on
numbers.  Supported special times are: 'now', 'yesterday' and 'tomorrow':
the latter are 24 hour offsets on 'now'.

utime accepts its input either from stdin or on the command line, e.g.

% echo 3 + 4 | ./utime
7
%

or...

% ./utime 3 + 4
7
%

The decorations 'seconds', 'minutes', 'hours' are accepted on numbers, making
this valid:

% ./utime now + 4 hours
[whatever now + 4 hours in seconds is when you run it]
%

If you need to know what local time is represented by a given Unix timestamp,
use the '-r' switch, e.g.:

% ./utime -r 1285532072
Sun Sep 26 21:14:32 2010
%
