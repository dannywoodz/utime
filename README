utime is a simple utility for outputting times in seconds since the Unix EPOC.

utime accepts its input either from stdin or on the command line, e.g.

% echo 3 + 4 | ./utime
7
%

or...

% ./utime 3 + 4
7
%

It understands 'now' and 'yesterday' as times, and also the decorations
'seconds', 'minutes', 'hours', making this valid:

% echo now + 4 hours | ./utime
[whatever now + 4 hours in seconds is when you run it]
%
